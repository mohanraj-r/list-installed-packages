List installed packages
=======================

List installed packages on Debian based systems.

This python script has been cloned from http://www.aifdr.org/projects/system_administration/browser/statistics/list_manually_installed_packages.py
(Found via http://superuser.com/questions/48374/find-all-user-installed-packages)

Tested on Mint 14 and works great so far. 

Cloning it here since I have been looking for such a script and because I think I can improve it.
